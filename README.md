# Phaser 3 Demo Project

A [Phaser 3][phsr] demo project powered by [Webpack][wbpk], based on the tutorial titled "Snake Plissken", published on [Phaser World #85][pw85]. Still a work in progress.


## Instructions

>   NOTE: It is highly recommended that you have at least Node.js version 6.11, and npm@5 installed to use this project.

This project embeds the Phaser 3 repository as a Git submodule. Use the `--recurse-submodules` option to clone this repository, as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/rblopes/phaser-3-snake-game.git --recurse-submodules
```

After that, you can install its dependencies using npm. To play the demo game, run `npm start`.
